# springboot-savingdata-to-mysql

In this project, it shows an example on how you can create a spring boot project that saves data in mysql database.

The database configuration files are added under resourses in the application.properties file. This is after a user has created a mysql database using their favourite MySQL database console.

The project then uses an MVC model to fetch data and store data. The data is stored in JSON format, and can easily be tested using the URLs on the controller file.
